# Selection Sort Algorithm

## Introduction

For an integer array of length n, in each iteration find the minimum element from the unsorted subarray and swap it with the first element of unsorted subarray.

Initially length of unsorted subarray = n, length of sorted subarray = 0.

After each iteration length of unsorted subarray will decrease by 1 and length of sorted subarray will increase by 1.

After n iterations, length of sorted subarray = n.

It's an inplace sorting algorithm.

Worst case space complexity = O(1).

Worst case time complexity = O(nÂ²).
